## 📌 1. Introduction: Why CTC Exists & Its Purpose
### 🔍 Problem Statement
The Chicago tech ecosystem is thriving yet fragmented. Many founders, investors, community organizers and operators operate across digital silos, creating an opportunity for an aligned, ecosystem first, unified way to connect, collaborate, and provide visibility of Chicago’s vibrant tech scene and talent. The Chicago Tech Community (CTC) was founded with the intention to bridge gaps by facilitating innovation, fostering meaningful connections, and building a unified tech network that strengthens the entire ecosystem.
